# linker-landing

The public portal of the Linker platform, shipped under the product name **Kitlet**:
marketing landing, and later auth, the account cabinet and legal pages. The plan is
[`docs/portal-plan.md`](docs/portal-plan.md); the brand logos are in `brand/logos/`.

Angular 22, marketing routes prerendered at build time, `outputMode: "static"` — no
Node server in production; a CDN serves `dist/kitlet-portal/browser/`.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start     # dev server on http://localhost:4000
pnpm build     # static output in dist/kitlet-portal/browser
pnpm test      # Vitest unit tests
pnpm format
```

`linker.com` in `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` and `APP_IDENTITY`
(`src/app/core/config/app-identity.ts`) is a placeholder until the Kitlet domain is
registered (plan milestone M8).
